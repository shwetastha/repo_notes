## Introduction

**_Intro_**:
- ML grew out of work in AI
- Examples:
	- Database Mining: Large datasets from growth  of automation/web.- Web Click data, medical records, biology, engineering.
	- Applications can't program by hand. Autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition, NLP, Computer Vision
	- self customizing programs. amazon, netflix, product recommendations
	- Understanding human learning
- Machine Learning:
	- program learn without explicitly programmed
	- Well posed learning problem
- ML Algorithms:
	- Supervised Learning: teach the computer
	- Unsupervised Learning: learn it by it self
	- Reinforcement Learning
	- Recommender systems
- Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."
- Supervised Learning:
	- eg1: Housing Pricing
		- Price vs Size in feet
		- Learning Algorithm:
			- straight line through the graph
			- quadratic function
			- whichever one gives the better result
		- "right answers" were given
		- Regression : Predict continuous valued output
	- eg2: Breast Cancer malignant or benign
		- Malignant vs Tumor Size: plotted in O(N) and 1(Y)
		- can you estimate what is malignant vs benign
		- This is a classification problem: 0 or 1
		- Classification: Descrete Valued output
		- only used 1 feature or 1 attribute: tumor size
		- 2 feature: Age of patient and tumor size
	- Supoort Vector Machine: Infinite number of features
	- Regression: given an input the model needs to predict an output
	- Classification: given an input the model needs to predict the class of the input
- Unsupervised Learning:
	- unlabelled data
	- find some structure with the data
	- clusters in the data
	- eg1: news.google.com:
		- clusters news in groups
		- same topic but groups them together from diferent sources
	- eg2: DNA Genes 
	- organize computing clusters
	- social network analysis
	- market segmentation
	- astronomical data analysis
	- Cocktail Party Algorithm 
	  	- 2 microphones - 2 speakers
		- seperates the 2 voice of the speakers
		- finding structure in a chaotic environment
	- Octave and Matlab
		- Octave programming environment
