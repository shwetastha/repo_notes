# Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and Tensorflow

## Part I: The Fundamentals of Machine Learning

**Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape**

“Machine Learning is great for:
- Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better.
- Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional approach: the best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.
- Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.
- Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.”
