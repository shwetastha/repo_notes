Chapter 12: The Science of Availability

The Psychology of Availabilty
- unexplained unavailability


*Chapter 13: Availability, Emotions, and Risk*
(13 Pages)
- Victims and near victims are concerned after there is a disaster.
- Memories fade and so does the concern.
- Images of worse disaster donot come to mind, as the protective actions are usually designed to be adequate to the worst one that actually happened. As if the flodd cannot rise higher than the last water mark.

_Availability and Affect_
- Research on public perception of risks (Availability Bias)
- done by Paul Slovic, Sarah Lichtenstein, Baruch Fischhoff
- Estimates of causes of death is warped by media coverage.
- Affect heuristic: decisions based on emotions.
- "The emotional tail wags the rational dog" - pyschologist Jonathan Haidt

_The Public and the Experts_
- “experts often measure risks by the number of lives (or life-years) lost, while the public draws finer distinctions, for example between “good deaths” and “bad deaths,”
- “risk regulation and government intervention to reduce risks should be guided by rational weighting of costs and benefits, and that the natural units for this analysis are the number of lives saved”
- Cass Sunstein - “risk regulation and government intervention to reduce risks should be guided by rational weighting of costs and benefits, and that the natural units for this analysis are the number of lives saved (or perhaps the number of life-years saved, which gives more weight to saving the young) and the dollar cost to the economy.”
- *The availability Cascade* - all heuristics are equal but availability is more equal than the others.
- the love canal affair and the so-called Alar scare
- The probability neglect: focusing on the numerator and not thinking about the denominator.


Chapter 14: Tom W's Speciality
(15 Pages)

- *Base Rate* - “the base rate of humanities and education in this problem is the proportion of students of that field among all the graduate students”

_Predicting by Representativeness_
- the personality description of Tom W was judged by the representativeness for the probability.
- the question about probability was hard and the question about similarity was easy so that was answered instead.

_The Sins of Representativeness_
- first sin: excessive willingness to predict he occurrence of unlikely / low base-rate events.
- when you have doubts about the quality of the evidence: let your judgments of probability stay close to the base rate. so reducing the high probabilities and increasing the low probabilities slightly.

_How to Discipline Intuition_
- Bayesiabn Statistics: Reverend Thomas Bayes. the logic of how people should change their mind in the light of evidence.
- “Bayes’s rule specifies how prior beliefs (in the examples of this chapter, base rates) should be combined with the diagnosticity of the evidence, the degree to which it favors the hypothesis over the alternative.”
- “The essential keys to disciplined Bayesian reasoning can be simply summarized:
	- Anchor your judgment of the probability of an outcome on a plausible base rate.
	- Question the diagnosticity of your evidence.”


Chapter 15: Linda: Less is More
(16 Pages)

- Representativeness won against logic.
- Conjunction Fallacy: when people judge a conjunction of 2 events to be more probable than one of the events in a direct comparison. 
- “The most coherent stories are not necessarily the most probable, but they are plausible, and the notions of coherence, plausibility, and probability are easily confused by the unwary”
- “adding detail to scenarios makes them more persuasive, but less likely to come true”
- “ In the absence of a competing intuition, logic prevails.”

_Less Is More, Sometimes Even In Joint Evaluation_
- joint evaluation: shown both among the 2 comparisons. within-subject experiment
- single evaluation: shown only one among the 2 comparison. between-subjects experiment
- “the larger sets were valued more than the smaller ones in joint evaluation, but less in single evaluation.”
? need to understand the less is more concept again.
