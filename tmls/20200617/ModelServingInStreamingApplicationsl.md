# Model Servingin Streaming Applications

Presenter: Boris Lublinsky

## Model Serving as a Service
- Simple:
	- Tensorflow Serving
	- Pytorch Serving
	- XGnboost
- Optimized:
	- Seldon
- Serverless:
	- KF Serving

## How do applicaitons interact with models?
- embedding? Scaling? how other systems access it?
